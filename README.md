# Solving Star Battle with Z3

A Python script that solves [Star Battle](https://www.puzzle-star-battle.com/) puzzles, using the Z3 SMT solver. The essential work is done in ```solver.py```.

Some sample puzzles are included in ```sample_puzzles.py```.

To run locally, you need to ```pip install z3-solver```.

On my machine, it took 2.8 secs to solve a 3-star 14x14 puzzle.
